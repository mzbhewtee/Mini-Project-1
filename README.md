# Mini-Project-1
The Hospital Booking App is a user-friendly platform designed to streamline the process of booking appointments with healthcare providers. The app functions by allowing patients to search for and select a healthcare provider, view the provider's availability and schedule an appointment at a time that is convenient for them.

To run the project: 
- `cd hospital_app`
- Connect your emulator
- `flutter run`
